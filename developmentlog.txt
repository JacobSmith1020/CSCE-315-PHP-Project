CSCE 315 Project 1 part 3 development log

11:15am,9/13/20: search function will now take in a keyword input from the user and
detect if said keyword appears in any php pages associated with this web site, using
the strpos function to detect a match and its position within a given file. 

11:32am,9/13/20: search function will now not only display whether a keyword is in a
php file but will also display the url for the user to access the page where the
match was found.

1:56pm,9/13/20: all functions (proc_csv(), proc_wikitext(), proc_gallery(), and
search()) have been moved out of the main index.php file if they were there already
and placed into their own file. Additionally, page links have been set up at the
bottom of every page to navigate between the different pages of the site (main,
gallery, blog, etc.).

5:43pm,9/13/20: all pages are finalized and connected to each other via the page links
section at the bottom of each page.
